# Podhelp
A repositroy containing 3 scripts I use for managing my podcast, blog and RSS Feeds.
These scripts are tailored to my needs, so if you want to use them you have to edit them.

1. podrec
This script just starts some programs I like to have running while recording my podcast and prompts me for saving details of the episode.

2. podhelp
This script is used to update my podcast rss feed

3. bloghelp
This script is used to update my blog rss feed
